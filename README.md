# nc-education-voting

Here are graphics produced from the New York Times/Siena College Polls from 2018 for the 9th district of North Carolina. 

The first graphic uses the final_weight variable, which gives how much the weight each person's vote is given in the calculations. With a violin plot showing the distribution of weight variable and the level of education for people here, we can see that more educated people are given less weight.

The second graphic counts the votes for people in each age range and shows that, as is expected, younger people vote much less than older people.
